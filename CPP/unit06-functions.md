# Unit 6: Functions

## Overview

This unit covers definitions, parameters, arguments, return values, scope, collection parameters, variadic functions. Follow the same problem progression as Python so that the main comparison is language syntax and semantics. Use the worked examples as starting points, then complete the activities independently.

## Lesson 6.1: Defining functions

### Reading References
- Official C++ language guide and standard-library documentation.
- Corresponding Python course lesson for the shared problem context and learning objective.

### Learning Objectives
- Explain this concept using C++ terminology.
- Trace a short program and predict its behavior before execution.
- Modify and test the example independently.

### Concept Explanation
Defining functions is taught through the shared course datasets and requirements. The Python curriculum supplies a common problem context, not syntax to translate mechanically. In C++, make the type system, object lifetime, standard-library contracts, ownership, and failure behavior explicit. This lesson focuses on: declare functions before use; ensure every non-void path returns; match return types to the contract.

### Worked Example
```cpp
const auto calculate_total = [](double bill, double rate) { return bill * (1.0 + rate); }; std::cout << "Bill plus tip: $" << calculate_total(24.50, 0.15) << '\n';
```

**Trace:** predict the output before compiling. Identify declarations, values, control-flow decisions, and state changes in order. Then compile and compare actual output with the prediction. The lesson example is intended to be independently compilable.

### Expected Behavior or Output

Output observed when the worked example was run with empty standard input (g++ 13.3, C++20; the text of the output does not depend on the operating system):

```text
Bill plus tip: $28.175
```

### Common Mistakes
- Declare functions before use.
- Ensure every non-void path returns.
- Match return types to the contract.

### Activities
1. Trace the defining functions example and predict its output before compiling.
2. Adapt the example to reusable score and inventory functions and preserve the same observable requirement using idiomatic C++20.
3. Add one boundary case and one invalid or missing-data case; state the expected result and implement the handling.
4. Write a short test or trace table, then explain the C++ type, lifetime, ownership, iterator, or error-handling rule that matters here.

### Accessibility Practice
Navigate the complete source file by line, word, and character using the learner's access technology. Read punctuation and indentation, run from the terminal, and inspect standard output and errors sequentially.

This lesson focuses on: never return a reference to a local; document failure/sentinel behavior; distinguish returning a value from printing.

### Worked Example
```cpp
const auto tip_total = [](double bill, double rate) { return bill * (1.0 + rate); }; const double total = tip_total(24.50, 0.15); std::cout << "Total: $" << total << '\n';

### Concept Explanation
Functions over collections is taught through the shared course datasets and requirements. The Python curriculum supplies a common problem context, not syntax to translate mechanically. In C++, make the type system, object lifetime, standard-library contracts, ownership, and failure behavior explicit. This lesson focuses on: avoid copying a collection when a const reference suffices; define empty-input behavior; select an accumulator wide enough.

### Worked Example
```cpp
const auto average = [](const std::vector<int>& scores) { if (scores.empty()) return 0.0; const int sum = std::accumulate(scores.begin(), scores.end(), 0); return static_cast<double>(sum) / scores.size(); }; std::cout << "Average: " << average({82, 91, 76, 88}) << '\n';

### Concept Explanation
Scope and variadic arguments is taught through the shared course datasets and requirements. The Python curriculum supplies a common problem context, not syntax to translate mechanically. In C++, make the type system, object lifetime, standard-library contracts, ownership, and failure behavior explicit. This lesson focuses on: respect block scope; write fold expressions that match the parameter pack; constrain or document mixed argument types.

### Worked Example
```cpp
const auto sum = []<typename... Values>(Values... values) { return (values + ...); }; std::cout << "Sum: " << sum(2, 3, 4) << '\n';

```

**Trace:** predict the output before compiling. Identify declarations, values, control-flow decisions, and state changes in order. Then compile and compare actual output with the prediction. The lesson example is intended to be independently compilable.
