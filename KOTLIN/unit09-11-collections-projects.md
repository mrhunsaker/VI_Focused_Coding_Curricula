# Kotlin: Testing, analysis, and projects

This course sequence aligns Kotlin with the shared 12-unit curriculum map. Each mapped lesson includes all nine standard instructional sections. Examples target Kotlin/JVM. The terminal-first workflow is the default for accessible, reproducible work.

### Lesson 9.1: Testing a Function

#### Reading References
- [Kotlin language documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html)
- [Kotlin basic syntax](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/basic-syntax.html)
- Shared alignment: Python curriculum Unit 9; use the corresponding Java topic for syntax comparison.

#### Learning Objectives
- Explain the lesson concept using Kotlin terminology and semantics.
- Trace a Kotlin example and identify its input, output, and important types.
- Identify a boundary case and one likely implementation error.

#### Concept Explanation
Kotlin is statically typed. The compiler may infer a declaration's type, but the type remains fixed. Prefer val for read-only bindings and var only when reassignment is required. Distinguish read-only collection interfaces from mutable interfaces, and validate data received from users, files, networks, or Java APIs. Apply the lesson concept to the shared course datasets and preserve the original problem's inputs and expected behavior.

#### Worked Example
```kotlin
data class Record(
    val id: Int,
    val title: String,
    val description: String,
    val category: String,
    val createdAt: String,
    val updatedAt: String
)
val record = Record(1, "Plan", "Course work", "School", "2026-11-01", "2026-11-01")
println(record.title)
```

#### Expected Behavior or Output
The program prints Plan. The record retains the six shared capstone fields; full CRUD and persistence behavior must be tested separately.

#### Common Mistakes
- Assuming type inference makes Kotlin dynamically typed or that numeric types convert implicitly.
- Using !! on untrusted values instead of parsing and validating them.
- Confusing read-only collection access with deep immutability.
- Treating successful compilation as proof that the algorithm meets its requirements.

#### Activities
1. Trace the example and state the type of each named value.
2. Change one input to a boundary value and predict the behavior before running it.
3. Explain one invalid-input or failure case and specify the expected user-facing response.
4. Adapt the concept to the canonical shared dataset for this unit.

#### Accessibility Practice
- Navigate by headings, functions, classes, and logical blocks using keyboard commands.
- Configure punctuation and indentation announcements; explicitly verbalize Kotlin symbols including question mark, safe-call, Elvis, not-null assertion, arrow, and generic brackets.
- Prefer named intermediate values over deeply nested expressions when that improves auditory comprehension.
- Read compiler diagnostics from the beginning, including file, line, column, and message; verify output using keyboard-only terminal navigation.

#### Skills Checklist
- [ ] I can explain the concept and its Kotlin-specific behavior.
- [ ] I can identify the types and possible null values involved.
- [ ] I can predict the example's behavior before execution.
- [ ] I can test an ordinary case and a boundary case.
- [ ] I can navigate and understand the lesson with keyboard and screen-reader output.

### Lesson 11.2: Data Model, Validation, and Storage

#### Reading References
- [Kotlin language documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html)
- [Kotlin basic syntax](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/basic-syntax.html)
- Shared alignment: Python curriculum Unit 11; use the corresponding Java topic for syntax comparison.

#### Learning Objectives
- Explain the lesson concept using Kotlin terminology and semantics.
- Trace a Kotlin example and identify its input, output, and important types.
- Identify a boundary case and one likely implementation error.

#### Concept Explanation
Kotlin is statically typed. The compiler may infer a declaration's type, but the type remains fixed. Prefer val for read-only bindings and var only when reassignment is required. Distinguish read-only collection interfaces from mutable interfaces, and validate data received from users, files, networks, or Java APIs. Apply the lesson concept to the shared course datasets and preserve the original problem's inputs and expected behavior.

#### Worked Example
```kotlin
data class Record(
    val id: Int,
    val title: String,
    val description: String,
    val category: String,
    val createdAt: String,
    val updatedAt: String
)
val record = Record(1, "Plan", "Course work", "School", "2026-11-01", "2026-11-01")
println(record.title)
```

#### Expected Behavior or Output
The program prints Plan. The record retains the six shared capstone fields; full CRUD and persistence behavior must be tested separately.

#### Common Mistakes
- Assuming type inference makes Kotlin dynamically typed or that numeric types convert implicitly.
- Using !! on untrusted values instead of parsing and validating them.
- Confusing read-only collection access with deep immutability.
- Treating successful compilation as proof that the algorithm meets its requirements.

#### Activities
1. Trace the example and state the type of each named value.
2. Change one input to a boundary value and predict the behavior before running it.
3. Explain one invalid-input or failure case and specify the expected user-facing response.
4. Adapt the concept to the canonical shared dataset for this unit.

#### Accessibility Practice
- Navigate by headings, functions, classes, and logical blocks using keyboard commands.
- Configure punctuation and indentation announcements; explicitly verbalize Kotlin symbols including question mark, safe-call, Elvis, not-null assertion, arrow, and generic brackets.
- Prefer named intermediate values over deeply nested expressions when that improves auditory comprehension.
- Read compiler diagnostics from the beginning, including file, line, column, and message; verify output using keyboard-only terminal navigation.

#### Skills Checklist
- [ ] I can explain the concept and its Kotlin-specific behavior.
- [ ] I can identify the types and possible null values involved.
- [ ] I can predict the example's behavior before execution.
- [ ] I can test an ordinary case and a boundary case.

### Lesson 11.4: Searching, Updating, and Deleting Records

#### Reading References
- [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html)
- Shared capstone acceptance criteria and accessible interface requirements.

#### Learning Objectives
- Implement search, update, and delete operations using stable record identifiers and clearly defined matching rules.
- Preserve the shared record schema and user-facing behavior.
- Verify the operation with deterministic tests.

#### Concept Explanation
Treat each operation as a defined state transition. Validate input before changing stored data, preserve identifiers, update timestamps consistently, and report success or failure in text. A terminal menu is an appropriate Kotlin/JVM implementation; a visual interface is not required.

#### Worked Example
```kotlin
data class Record(val id: Int, val title: String, val done: Boolean)
val records = mutableListOf(Record(1, "Plan", false))
val updated = records.map { record ->
    if (record.id == 1) record.copy(done = true) else record
}
println(updated)
```

#### Expected Behavior or Output
The record with identifier 1 is returned with done=true; unrelated records remain unchanged.

#### Common Mistakes
- Updating the wrong record when identifiers are duplicated or missing.
- Mutating stored data before validation succeeds.
- Reporting success when persistence fails.
- Omitting a regression test for the state transition.

#### Activities
1. Specify preconditions and postconditions for the operation.
2. Test an existing identifier, an unknown identifier, and an empty collection.
3. Verify that unrelated records remain unchanged.
4. Add a persistence round-trip test.

#### Accessibility Practice
Use explicit menu labels, predictable result messages, and keyboard-operable commands. Announce validation failures and successful state changes in text; never communicate state only through color or position.

#### Skills Checklist
- [ ] I can explain the operation's preconditions and postconditions.
- [ ] I can preserve the shared record schema.
- [ ] I can test success, missing-record, and invalid-input cases.
- [ ] I can verify the operation using keyboard and screen-reader output.

}
println(updated)
```
